# Dragons-Den

## Project Description:
Dragon’s Den is an application used by amateur critics of book clubs. It will be a place where readers can access basic information of the books they have read (i.e. title, author, ISBN, edition, and genre), allowing them to input their critique of the book and rate their experience.

Once the Reader has introduced their comments/critique of the book they have read, the comments will be saved in Dragon’s Den database. This critique will then become available to future readers who either wish to research comments made by previous contributors, and/or add theeir own comments/critique.

## User Story:
As a member of book club, I want to be able to read other people’s critique or share my own critique as it relates to books that I have read with members of the various book club communities.

## User Workflow:
WHEN I open the application and reach the landing page,
THEN I am prompted to provide my full name, book club affiliation, email, and password.
AFTER providing my name and affiliation,
THEN I am asked to login in order to verify credentials.
AFTER I login,
THEN I am asked to determine whether I want to review other member’s critique or add my own.
IF I choose to review other member’s critique,
THEN I am asked for the author or the title of the book.
IF I insert the author,
THEN I am taken to a table which outlines all books written by that author and I am asked to choose the title of the book I wish to review.
IF I insert the title of the book,
THEN I am taken directly to the page where the basic information of the book is listed along with the critique and ratings.
IF I choose to add my own critique,
THEN I am asked to add the book’s basic information (i.e. author, title, ISBN, genre and edition) and my own critique.
ONCE my critique has been added,
THEN I am asked to save the information which will be stored in Dragon’s Den database for posterity and use by other readers.

## Next Steps:
1. Scale application by connecting to third-party API’s (i.e. Google Books, Amazon, etc.) to obtain basic information, a synopsis, and comments from other sources.
2. Connect to book stores in order to allow members to acquire books immediately after reading comments.
3. Include images of book covers in order to provide a visual representation of the book they wish to comment or research.
4. Add a five star rating model.
